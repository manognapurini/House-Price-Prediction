House Price Prediction

**Overview**

This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques. It analyzes historical housing data, identifies important features affecting prices, and builds a regression model to estimate house prices accurately.

**Problem Statement**

House price estimation is important for buyers, sellers, and real estate businesses. This project uses past housing data to predict house prices based on multiple features such as area, number of rooms, and location-related attributes.
